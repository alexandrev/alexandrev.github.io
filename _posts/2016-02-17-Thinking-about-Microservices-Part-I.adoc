# Thinking about Microservices - Part I 

:hp-tags: Microservices, Architecture


I've been reading a lot the past weeks about the Microservices Architectural stlye and I've been facing a difficult phase of understanding this approach completely. That's because Microservices seems to be suffering the same problem that Martin Fowler described about SOA in link:http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ServiceOrientedAmbiguity.html[Service Oriented Ambiguity]. It seems to be one different description of the approach depending on who are you talking to. 

So, my main goal in this post (or maybe set of posts, I'm not sure if all this thoughts should be on one post or a few of them) is to put it common all this different thoughts and think about them and I'll try to have my own understanding. 

We are going to start with the definition of the term that is perfectly accepted by all teh community. The definition is from Martin Fowler and James Lewis:
	
____
In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

So, the main idea is we can highlight a few key aspects:

- Application is a set of services.
- Each services run in its own process.
- Built around business capabilities.
- Communication using lightweight protocols.
- Minimum centralized management.
- Differente programming languages and data storage technologies.



Ok, we understand the key points but, if you are aware of Service Oriented Architecture, which are the key differences between them? We are going from one to one.

### Application is a set of services

Ok, with SOA its the same. The main goal (and the sales pitch) about SOA is that you are going to create a lot of business services so you can create your own application only invoking those services to fulfill these needs. So, at the paper level, no difference here.

But I don't want to be naive here, so many articles talks about an important difference between both of the architectural styles here. SOA it is for enterprise and Microservices it is for application. So, SOA is a wide-range architectural style where all the features across your enterprise are available to be invoke and to be reused. But, using the Microservices architectural design, you are decomposing your application logic among different services. So, if you follow that thoughts you should think about SOA as a high-level approach and Microservices low-level services approach.

For example, link:http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1601_clark-trs/1601_clark.html[this article] published on IBM DeveloperWorks from Kim J Clark  covers this approach.

### Each services run in its own process

Ok, with initial SOA probably this features of this approach couldn't be fulfilled but nowadays Enterprise Services Bus, Distributed Computing Platform or every name you want to use to name the place where you deploy your services follows that approach. For example, I'm as a TIBCO expert with many years of experiences I'm used to see that approach since the begining. TIBCO AMX BusinessWorks since the first versions follows that approach with processes (its the way how the called their services) runs in their own OS processes and could be scale independently.

Once again, here you are going to find that using the Microservices Architecture style the container concept it is to related and the link:https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/infrastructure-code-reason-smile[Infraestructure as Code] approach but that is nothing that are owned by Microservices. So, you can use the same approach to your old-fashion SOA approach.

### Built around business capabilities.
### Communication using lightweight protocols.
### Minimum centralized management.
### Differente programming languages and data storage technologies.
