# Update on the Microsoft Band 2 SDK to solve Android 6.0.1 problem

If you are using the Microsoft Band 2 SDK to develop and build some solutions, you might be aware that with the latest version of the SDK: 1.3.10929.1. you were facing a problem when you try to connect your band with your phone.

Microsoft was aware of that situation as they told me via email when I notice them the issue:

"Thank you for your email. This is a breaking change introduced with Android 6.0.1 which causes the SDK to fail to enumerate a connected Microsoft Band. We are working on a fix that will address this problem. "

But the January 7th the release an update to the Microsoft Band 2 SDK to solve that issue (version 1.3.20105.2):

"The updated SDK is now available at http://developer.microsoftband.com/bandsdk/ 

The health app was updated to address the same issue as part of a previous update. "

So, now, if you are using Android 6.0.1 on your phone, you can use again the mBandroid solution.
