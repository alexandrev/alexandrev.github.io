# Thinking in Microservices

:hp-tags: Microservices, Architecture

I've been reading a lot the past weeks about the Microservices Architectural stlye and I've been facing a difficult phase of understanding this approach completely. That's because Microservices seems to be suffering the same problem that Martin Fowler described about SOA in Service Oriented Ambiguityn[http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ServiceOrientedAmbiguity.html]. It seems to be one different description of the approach depending on who are you talking to. 

So, my main goal in this post (or maybe set of posts, I'm not sure if all this thoughts should be on one post or a few of them) is to put it common all this different thoughts and think about them and I'll try to have my own understanding.
