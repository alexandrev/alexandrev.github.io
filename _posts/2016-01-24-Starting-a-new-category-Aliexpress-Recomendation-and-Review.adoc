# Starting a new category: Aliexpress Recomendation & Review

:hp-tags: Aliexpress, Buyer

Along my techie profile and open source developer I'm a Aliexpress lover and I try a lot of items from this store. I guess everyone of you already know Aliexpress (do you image that I have to explain someone what Amazon is?) but it is a big store firstly focus on big demand of product of any kind but since 2014 started to sell items to individual customers. 

They sell items from China of every kind, but my favourite are technology gadgets and items related to technology. They are very cheap but their quality is not great, so you don't expect a premium item like a Logitech, Microsoft, Apple or so, but they do the work most of the time. 

There is no site you can find a good review or recommendation about their products, like individual customers on non-oficial site to share their feelings and daily usage.

You can find things like the subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/BestAliExpressFinds/ but it is only links to the official web page.

So, in my humble opinion I want to fill that gap but this is not a "big review site" or I'm going to review every time available on Aliexpress but I'm going to do a review of any item I receive and I use with the price I paid and my experience. So, if you are a technology buyer addict, stay tuned for new postes about this topic!
